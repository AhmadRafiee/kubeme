# Kubernetes CSI Storage Gide  

### Blockbridge provides a Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver to deliver persistent, secure, multi-tenant, cluster-accessible storage for Kubernetes. This [Link](https://kb.blockbridge.com/guide/kubernetes/) describes how to deploy Blockbridge as the storage backend for Kubernetes containers.

### If youâ€™ve configured other Kubernetes storage drivers before, you may want to start with the Quickstart section. The rest of the guide has detailed information about features, driver configuration options and troubleshooting.
